## STAT & MATH MODELS for WATER RESOURCES & WATER TRANSPORTATION

### INTRO

Welcome to this coding work corresponding to the unit MA52124 Advanced topics in statistical applied math at the Univeristy of Bath. In this project, you'll get a very beginning of relevant models for water resources and water transportation. <br>

### Structures

The project is consist of three subbranches, which you can find in the above files: <br>

|---Stat_models
|   |---NRFA
|       |---baseline_NRFA.ipynb  # The main framework
|       |---Dataset_NRFA         # dataset, if it doesn't work, you can find them via website: [NRFA](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/search)
|       |---NRFA_outputs         # figures
|   |---HDE
|       |---baseline_HDE.ipynb  # The main framework
|       |---Dataset_HDE         # dataset, if it doesn't work, you can find them via website: [HDE](https://environment.data.gov.uk/hydrology/explore)
|       |---HDE_outputs         # figures
|
|
|---Math_models
|   |---wetropolis_periodic.ipynb       # a framework with periodic rainfall
|   |---wetropolis_Bath_Avon.ipynb      # a framework in real scale
|   |---wetropolis_Bath_Avon_Stat.ipynb # a framework in real scale with stat analysis
|   |---Wetropois_outputs               # figures
|
|
|---Inverse_models
|   |---Inverse_toy_model_investigation_version1.1.ipynb   # a framework of 1D inverse model
|   |---inverse_outputs                                    # figures

### Requirements

There is no special package in this project. 

### Usage

Every jupyter notebook is written for a specific model/task. You can get a quick start by running the notebook yourself. Please modify the paths of datasets if necessary.
