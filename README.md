## STAT & MATH MODELS for WATER RESOURCES & WATER TRANSPORTATION

### INTRO

Welcome to this coding work corresponding to the unit MA52124 Advanced topics in statistical applied math at the University of Bath. In this project, you'll get a very basic understanding of relevant models for water resources and water transportation. <br>

### Structures

The project consists of three sub-branches, which you can find in the above files: <br>

|---Stat_models <br>
|&emsp;|---NRFA <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|---baseline_NRFA.ipynb &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# The main framework <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|---Dataset_NRFA        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# dataset, if it doesn't work, you can find them via website: [NRFA](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/search) <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|---NRFA_outputs        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# figures <br>
|&emsp;|---HDE <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|---baseline_HDE.ipynb  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# The main framework <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|---Dataset_HDE         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# dataset, if it doesn't work, you can find them via website: [HDE](https://environment.data.gov.uk/hydrology/explore) <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|---HDE_outputs         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# figures <br>
| <br>
| <br>
|---Math_models <br>
|&emsp;|---wetropolis_periodic.ipynb       &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# a framework with periodic rainfall <br>
|&emsp;|---wetropolis_Bath_Avon.ipynb      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# a framework in real scale <br>
|&emsp;|---wetropolis_Bath_Avon_Stat.ipynb &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# a framework in real scale with stat analysis <br>
|&emsp;|---Wetropois_outputs               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# figures <br>
| <br>
| <br>
|---Inverse_models <br>
|&emsp;|---Inverse_toy_model_investigation_version1.1.ipynb   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# a framework of 1D inverse model <br>
|&emsp;|---inverse_outputs                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# figures <br>

### Requirements

There is no special package in this project. 

### Usage

Every Jupyter notebook is written for a specific model/task. You can get a quick start by running the notebook yourself. Please modify the paths of the datasets if necessary.
